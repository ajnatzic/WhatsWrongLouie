 *  This file makes the connection to the MongoDB database and uses the
 *  Route files to be able to interact with the DB collections.
 * 
 *  To connect to the mongoDB db:
 *  1. In the terminal, go to the directory my-app/backend
 *  2. Start the server by using the command "nodemon server"
 * 
 *  You may have to npm install nodemon if the package is missing.
