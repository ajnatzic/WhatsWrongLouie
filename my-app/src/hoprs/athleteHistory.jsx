I got rushed to the hospital immediately and as soon as I got to the hospital I was taken care off. The surgery went so well and so fast, the doctors did not mess anything up and it was perfect. My cast was taken off today and it felt amazing. After so long it was over and nothing bad happened while i had my cast. When they took it off it went smoothly and now Iâ€™m Back in the Game!"></textarea>
