/**
 * Currently, the Athlete History mini-game is static. 
 * 
 * The intended flow of this mini-game is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. Player selects relevant, underlined keywords based on what they believe is the cause of the injury in the "Story" textbox.
 * 
 * 2. The keywords selected by the player are placed into the "Knowlege" textbox. 
 * 
 * 3. Once the player is confident that they have selected the correct keywords, they will click the submit button. 
 *    Upon submission, their answers will be validated with the History keywords defined by the super-user.

My cast was taken off today and it felt amazing. After so long it was over and nothing bad happened while i had my cast.
